Today I started my project, wrote my project proposal and made my design document. Did a standup with Levy and Luc, 
because I did not have a group of my own yet. We talked about our ideas mostly, not yet about the implementation of them.

## 06-06-2019

I had my mentor-group with Natasja today, there we talked about the process of the entire course. 
I found firebase online, which is a google database in which data can be saved securely with the extra benefit that
my database alawys works and not only when I host it myself (such as Rester). Therefore I decided I want to try to 
implement this database instead of Rester. Natasja discouraged this, but offered to help me with it anyway since she
has some experience with firebase.
Secondly I am doubting between two API's I could use to render my map. The first is the most obvious one: google maps API.
The second is Mapbox. I am leaning towards Mapbox, since it allows for a more custom style implementation and is cheaper in big use.

Google maps seems easier however, so I might still switch if Mapbox turns out to give to much trouble.

## 07-06-2019

Had my first standup with my definitive group: Felix and Darian. We discussed about the API's and Darian recommended me to use Google maps
because it worked so easily for him. If mapbox still doesn't work by tomorrow I will switch. 
Furthermore they encouraged me to use firebase, but pointed out that Rester might be easier because we have a lot of experience with it.

I switched to the Gooogle Maps API today, due to dificulties getting the Mapbox API working. The Google maps API seems to work better but I do
am not too familiar with it yet. I hope to get a firm understanding of how the API works, so tomorrow I can start with my database.
Everyone of our standup group took the weekend of, so we had not that many new things to discuss. We talked about API's a bit and our goals 
for today and the rest of the week.

Due to personal circumstances did not manage to work today.

## 18-06-2019

Worked at home. Due to the time I lost I decided to restructure my project. 
The biggest changes I decided to make:

- less functionalities, only what's really necessary for the app to work.
- Switch to Rester database, because I already have some familiarity with this one opposed to Firebase. 

Today I worked on the simplest implementation of the database and the login activity. 

## 19-06-2019

During the standup I talked with Darian about Rester. Since he is working with rester from the start of his project he could help me with some struggles I had with the way to safe my data. By hardcoding one user I managed to make the database operational for this one user.

## 20-06-2019

Today we had the TA meating, which came down to: just work really hard to get it done. The rest of the day I used to make the database operational for multiple users. Tomorrow I hope to be able to start with updating the locations list in the database and adding markers to the users own map.

## 21-06-2019

I made the addLocationActivity functional, meaning a user can add a marker to his map by longclicking on it and giving info about this place. It updates the rester database automatically after adding the marker. 

## 24-06-2019

I made the login activity, the mapViewActivity and started on the friendsViewActivity, friendsAddActivity and the FriendsAdapter.

## 25-06-2019

Today I made the drawerlayout in the mainactivity, making the app look a lot better. Also finished the friendsViewActivity, FriendsAddActivity and FriendsAdapter. 

## 26-06-2019

I made the FriendsMapView today and added onclicklisteners to the friendsViewActivity to get to the friendsMapView. I debugged a bit and renamed my badly named variables. Furthermore, I added dialogs to the onclicklisteners of the markers, so information about the place to which the marker belongs can be shown. Lastly I added comments to all of my files and adjusted the style of some layout files a bit.
